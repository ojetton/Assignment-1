# Assignment 1: ggplot2

This repo contains starter code for your first assignment, which is simply to practice and show off some of your newly acquired **ggplot2** skills.

The repo structure is as follows:

```
repo
|
-- README.md
|
-- .gitignore
|
-- data
|  |
|  -- (empty)
|
-- R
   |
   -- ggplot2.Rmd

```

You should clone this repo using the RStudio Project method that we practiced in class. Then, I want you to open up the `R/ggplot2.Rmd` (i.e. R Markdown) file where you will find the questions and basic template for providing your answers. You should complete the assignment by inserting text and R code chunks (like we practiced in class) in the relevant spaces. Whenever you "knit" this `R/ggplot2.Rmd` file, you will produce a corresponding `R/ggplot2.md` (i.e. GitHub-flavoured Markdown) file, as well as some auxilliary folders. Don't worry too much about this now; they are just to help speed things up and my template should take care of everything for you.

Don't forget to submit (i.e. push) your assignments before the deadline!
